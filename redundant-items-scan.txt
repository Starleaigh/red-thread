Red Thread Redundancy Scan (excluding src)
Date: 2026-02-11

High-confidence redundant/stale items

2) Unused actor type placeholders - Held for future use
- Files: system.json, manifest.json
- Keys: documentTypes.Actor.poi, documentTypes.Actor.casefile
- Why: Declared but no sheet/model/templates registered for these types yet. Keep only if intentionally reserved.

3) Unused template wiring/state in investigator sheet - Look into pages & pagesData
- File: system/actors/investigator-sheet.js
- Item: const pages = pagesData.map(...) is computed then not returned/used.

7) Large commented legacy drag implementations - Pull out drag code for referenced scale origins
- File: system/actors/investigator-sheet.js
- Block: "OLD DRAG CODE KEEP FOR POTENTIAL..." and following drag variants/bounds block.
- Why: Entire blocks are commented and superseded by active drag logic above.

9) Evidence sheet redundant/unused fields/options - Examine these
- File: system/actors/evidence-sheet.js
- Item: typingInterval, typingTimeout, lastValues are declared but never used.
- Item: template is declared in PARTS.main and repeated again in DEFAULT_OPTIONS (duplicate config).
- Item: resizeable appears misspelled (Foundry uses resizable), so this option is effectively nonfunctional.

10) Unreferenced image assets - Remove unused assets
- Folder: assets/images
- Files: 586.jpg, Coven-Bw.bmp, default-profile.avif, default-profile.bmp, paperclip-back.png
- Why: No references found in templates/system/styles (excluding src).

11) Dev-only planning notes
- File: Roadmap.txt
- Why: Not runtime code; safe to keep as docs, but irrelevant to shipped behavior.

Notes
- Kept out of this list: active files and assets currently referenced (e.g., Coven-trans.png, paperclip-front.png, default-profile.jpg, sound assets).
- This is a static usage scan; dynamic references via external modules/macros are always a possible exception.
